### Project Description
This playful maze game uses Pygame to render a grid‚Äëbased labyrinth. You guide a snail emoji üêå cursor via the mouse (telekinesis not required), trying to reach the finish without clipping the walls. Fail, and PyAutoGUI audibly (but imperceptibly) snaps you back to start.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Speed‚Äërunners want a snail‚Äëcontrolled maze where walled pathways feel instant and ominous‚Ä¶ because moving slowly at high stakes is ironically dramatic.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter Snail Maze Escape ‚Äî a full‚Äëscreen maze generator with üêå emoji cursor and wall‚Äëpenalty resets. Touch a wall and you instantly teleport back to the start. It‚Äôs gratuitously snail-paced and spectacularly unnecessary.
