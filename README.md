# Snail Maze Escape 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Incognito


### Team Members

### Project Description
This fullscreen Pygame maze game uses PyAutoGUI to tug your snail emoji 🐌 cursor back to the start upon any wall collision. Navigate the labyrinth by mouse, reach the 🏁 finish flag, and trigger the 10‑second exit countdown. Purposefully low‑speed, high drama. The mouse pointer will be trapped in the game; we need to finish the game to escape.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Maze games reward strategy—too useful. Here, each micro‑mistake results in immediate reset. It’s a gamified metaphor for snail-paced frustration.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A snail maze with snappy reset punishment—reckless collision detection via line‑sampling, full‑screen rendering, emoji-driven UI, and countdown closure. Built under time constraints, with zero concern for practical use.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
